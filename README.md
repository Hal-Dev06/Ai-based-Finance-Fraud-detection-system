AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System
A proof-of-concept for a real-time, AI-driven system to intelligently detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions. This project moves beyond traditional rule-based systems by using a model that learns from data to identify complex patterns and anomalies.

‚ú® Key Features
Predictive Fraud Scoring: Assigns a clear probability score (0-100%) to every transaction, indicating its likelihood of being fraudulent.

Explainable AI (XAI): Explains why a transaction is flagged, providing transparency and helping human analysts make faster, more informed decisions.

Imbalance Handling: Employs the SMOTE technique to effectively train the model on a highly imbalanced dataset, ensuring that rare fraud cases are not overlooked.

üöß Work in Progress
This repository represents the foundational data science phase of the project. The core machine learning model has been successfully built and evaluated.

There are several key enhancements planned for the future to evolve this proof-of-concept into a full-stack application:

Frontend Dashboard: Develop a dedicated user interface (e.g., using React.js) for human analysts to interact with the model in real-time.

API Deployment: Deploy the model as a scalable, cloud-based API (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI on AWS) to handle live transaction requests.

Automated Retraining: Implement a complete feedback loop where analyst feedback is stored in a database and used to automatically trigger model retraining.

Advanced Modeling: Experiment with other powerful algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM to further improve detection accuracy.
